* To developers
** Overview
This project uses [[http://www.cmake.org/][CMake]] as its management tool. Its directory tree is
organized as follows:

- root/
  - CMakeLists.txt
  - CMakeLists.txt.user
  - docs/
    - CMakeLists.txt
    - doc.org
  - lib/
    - assets/
    - pcs-detection/
    - raytracer/
    - CMakeLists.txt

The main build file is ~lib/CMakeLists.txt~. Previously we maintained
several of these, however this led to duplication of
information. ~CMakeLists.txt.user~ is a file generated by Qt
Creator. It shouldn't be shipped with the project.

Documentation is maintained as a single [[http://orgmode.org/][Org]] file. To generate a html
document from it, open a recent version of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] (23+) with orgmode
8.x.x+, then execute ~M-x org-html-export-to-html~.

The ~lib/~ folder contains the project source files, as some assets
for the UI. To build the project, create a build folder (say,
~root/build~), cd into it, then run ~cmake $PATH_TO_ROOT && make~. The
compiled binary will be ~lib/qtRaytracer~.

It is recommended to develop this project either in [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]] or
[[http://www.ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] (non-LTS, if possible). However, if you choose Ubuntu, pay
attention to the version of its packages, such as the Qt toolchain.

** Build Dependencies
*** Raytracer/pcs-detection Library
- AntTweakBar[fn:1] :: Illumination library
- Eigen 3.x+ :: a C++ linear algebra library
- Glew[fn:1] :: the OpenGL extension wrangler library
- Qt 4.x+ (Qt 5.x+ recommended) :: GUI Toolkit
- cmake 2.6.x+ (2.8.x+ recommended) :: build management tool
- g++ 4.6 (4.8+ recommended) :: C/C++ compiler
- vcglib[fn:1] :: Visualization and Computer Graphics library for
                  dealing with triangle meshes
*** Documentation
- Emacs 23.x+ (24.x+ recommended) :: text editor
- Orgmode 8.x+ :: markup language / documentation generator

** Hacking

It is recommended to use [[http://qt-project.org/][Qt Creator]] as your main IDE, together with
your favorite text editor.

Those principles are encouraged:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself][DRY]] :: don't repeat yourself
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle][KISS]] :: keep it short & simple

To speed up successive compilations, [[https://ccache.samba.org/][ccache]] is highly recommended.

[[http://feh.finalrewind.org/][feh]] is a simple image viewer.

* To final users

The main executable is ~lib/qtRaytracer~, just open it. The GUI should
be self explanatory.
